# simple-game

This is my first game... Flat Alice

Idea:
    - Block on canvas
    - Block moves with arrow keys
    - Block changes shape/size depending on what goodies it touches
    - Goal: match the shape/size of block to a warp zone to move to next level (or just win)
    - Dodge other shapes and obstacles

Stretch:
